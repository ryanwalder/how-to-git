# how-to-git

A repo with some branches and some pull requests designed to show how to:

* Make good commits
    * Not too much sausage (squash commits)
    * Not too little sausage (splitt commits)
* Make good Pull Requests
* Review Pull Requests like a boss
* Use the Fetch & Rebase method of working (rather than pull)

## Notes

Obviously some of this is very opinionated. I am working to the following principles when making this guide:

### Good commit messages

[This post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by [Chris Beams](https://github.com/cbeams) delves deep into what makes a good commit message and why.

### Good commits

We don't need to see how the sausage is made. A good commit should be the code needed for a single logical change. Nothing more, nothing less.

### Making pull requests

Much like the Good commits section above good Pull Requests make everyone's lives easier.
